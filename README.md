# NYT-Book-Search

The app should search the Google Books API when the user enters the name in the search box; however, I am receiving an error "UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON."  I have used a few work arounds that I found on git-hub and stack overflow, but it does not seem to be helping. I am not sure what to do.
